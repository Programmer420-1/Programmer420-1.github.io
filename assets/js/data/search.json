The first thing I would like to say is we are very proud of ourselves as a first year student to organize such programme that brings so much impact to the society. I would definitely say I have learnt so much through out this programme as one of the committee members. Before taking this university course, I have little experience in organizing an event and also in website development using advanced framework. Hence, this event really make my life different, my future brighter and my social network bigger. In this last update for this blog topic, I will like to share you what I have learnt.Teamwork makes the dreams work. This saying perfectly describe the lesson what I have learnt. Before becoming one of the organizing committee of this event, I usually work alone and solve the problem myself if I encountered one. It is devastating and frustating to do something that is difficult when there is no one to offer help to me. I have to do research on my own, seek for answer in the forums, scanning through each thread in the forum one by one in order to find the answer that fits my requirement. It can take me forever to find the answer without the assurance of the answer the be certainly found by me. After joining this programme as a committee member, I can finally not to work aloone again. Instead, I get to work with the BIG BRAINERS together and learn from their experiences. By working with them, I learn that teamwork is very important as we always work together to solve the problem we encountered when developing the website. We even share our development techniques generously to each other in order to help each other grow and develop a better website for this programme. Imagine going through all of the thing mentioned above, it will be so frustrating that I may even give up on continue doing the task I am assigned to.Besides, I also learned how to communicate with the others efficiently and confidently. During the preparation of this programme, I am offered the opportunity to express my opinions and ideas to the others in order to make the execution of this programme smoother and more imapctful to the society. At first, I wasn’t able to let all of the executive board to understand my ideas and my concerns towards some inappropriate arrangement of the protocol. I was also not being able to speak loudly and clearly as I was not confident enought to do so. However, in the long run, I learned to speak loudly and clearly when I am conveying my opinions to the others. I am so happy that this programme has helped me to change this introvert side of me to become more expressive and extroverted. In addition, I am not feeling anxious when I am getting in touch with someone I didn’t know before. I finally can make new friends easily now.Lastly, my technical skills have improved a lot after I joined this programme. This is the first time I develop a webpage with so many details and animations. Furthermore, the layout of the website is quite different from what I have done before. Moreover, this is also the first time I develop a website using React framework. All in all, this experiennce will certainly help me in many ways in my future if I am going to develop a new website again.In a nutshell, that’s what I have learnt throughout the whole programme. I am very excited to attend the closing ceremony which is on next week as this ceremony is the grand finale of the whole ceremony and I couldn’t bare to miss it. That’s it for my sharing, thank you for those who have accompanied me to the end of this event. Cheerio!!!" }, { "title": "The Real Deal - Commmunity Relation", "url": "/posts/Social-Engagement-3/", "categories": "Social Engagement", "tags": "social-engagement", "date": "2022-06-01 21:19:21 +0800", "snippet": "The &amp;lt;meta content&amp;gt;By the time of writing, we are carring out our 3rd module which is Digital Security - Scams and Swindles 101. Many things have happened so far and I can’t wait to tell you all the stories. Let’s get started!Not a good start, but we are gaining greatnessDespite all the preparation we have made, we still cannot prevent all of the unexepcted situations from happening. During the kick off event of our project, the representative of our main collaborator which is Meta was not able to join the Microsoft Team channel we have set up. At that time I was freaking out as I can’t do anything about it to help getting the representative into our Microsoft Team channel. Luckily, the others reacted quickly and decided to use Google Meet for as an alternative channel to continue the event. Then everything went smoothly like a hot knife through the butter.To date, we have over 60 teenagers participated the last 2 modules and the head count is still increasing! This has to do with the effort of Publicity Department(which is us) and all of the committees in promoting, advertising and spreading the details of our project consistently in our main social media platforms which are Facebook and Instagram. Without eveyone’s effort, our project will never stand a chance to attract so many participants and bring a lot of positive impact to the society by raising the awareness of digitalisation. I strongly believe that by the end of the project, we will have a total of 80 participants to join our project.Regrets, Sadness and SorrowAs I was involved in another event organized by Google, I was unable to attend the second module which is Digital Opportunity - D’ALGORITHMER, leaded by my friend Goh Qian Xuan. I didn’t get to watch my friend giving lecture and most importantly I didn’t get to listen to the content prepared by them. However, even though I was in another event, I still follow up with my teammates who were not involved in the Google event I was in at that time. Still, I feel sad as I was not able to attend the module.Lesson learntWhat have I learnt in this phase? Not much but fruitful I would say. After the Meta Representative Incident, I am aware that I have to improve my skill on handling unexpected situations. I should stay calm at time of crisis at all time in order to solve the problem more efficiently. I respect the other committees that solve this issue without getting panic. You guys really taught me a good lesson. Thanks!" }, { "title": "Work Work Work Work Work - The Project Execution", "url": "/posts/Social-Engagement-2/", "categories": "Social Engagement", "tags": "social-engagement", "date": "2022-05-12 18:19:21 +0800", "snippet": "The &amp;lt;meta content&amp;gt;From the last blog, we have done all the preparation for the works our department has to do. So now we will be make our planning comes true! As I am assigned (by myself) to develop the website, this blog will only focus on my perspective and my feelings while developingthe webstie. Without any further ado, lets goooooooooooooooo!“Yeah I think I can handle the landing page”For the non IT or webdev readers out there, you may be wondering what the heck is a landing page. Is it some sort of platform that allow something to land on? Well, yeah! A landing page is the first page user will see whent hey enter our website. So, the landing page has to be as attractive as possible. With only 10+ days of experience in learning React and 0 experience in developing a real, usable, built for an event website, I have picked up this important responsibility. I am feeling very excited but scared at the same time as I am scared that my work may not meet my teammates and my own expectations. But that is the story for later.Developers heaven: Desktop viewDeveloping the desktop view of the website is easy as the canvas is big and we can basically do anything we want. As long as the outcome is the same as the design, it is an ok for sure. So, I tried to fancy up the view a little but by adding in some animations. I have added hover effects for each and every buttons, revealling animations for some components, scroll animations and side navigation bar animations to the landing page. Still, after the additions, the landing apge looks dull. It is not “wow” enough. She is lacking of some spice to make her looks hot. It was at this time, Kuck Swee Nien, part of the developer team had sent me a DM. It was Particle.js, a lightweight JavaScript library for creating particles. The library is then integrated into the landingpage of the website and voila， the desktop view for the landing page is done!!!! I am very satisfied with the result.Developers hell: Mobile viewDone developing the website for destop? Yes. Is the job done? No… It is time to deal with the responsiveness of the webstie.What is website responsiveness? In non IT terms, it means how you make you website looks good even when the size of the viewport of users’ device varies. Sounds easy right? No. A BIG NO in full caps. To achieve that, we have to set the breakpoints of the website with respect to its width and organize the layout of the website to fit the size of the viewport. As the designer does not include the design for the mobile view, I have to come up with my own design of the mobile look of the website base on the desktop version. As I have mentioned before, I am pathetic when it comes to the field of art. But hwoever this will not be the reason to stop me from advancing. In order to produce the mobile view of the website, I consulted Nah Wan Jun, part of the developer team and has experience in developing a responsive website. What I can say is I learn many things from her to make the website responsive. Now, we have both mobile and desktop view, I say thats the end of the development of landing page. Hoorayyyyy!!!!!!!Exposing it to the worldAfter the development, we merged each part of the website into one and done the user routing part. It is time for us to put this baby to the World Wide Web, where it will be accessible to anyone from anywhere. We have deployed it onto Netlify, a free website hosting service platform. We were so happy when we saw the deployment log said “Deployed successfully. The website is up and running.”. We have put so much effort and time into this, it is time to let others acknowledge our work.The link for the website is here . Feel free to visit it!!Small Wrap Up - Execution of the ProjectWebsite development is fun but I think that normal people with 0 passion can do it. This is because the process of debugging and finetuning the website is very tedious and this requires a lot of patience to keep us from giving up. This is why I have mentioned a passion to learn new things is also one of the key criteria for this work.Besides, I also learned to express my ideas and cooperate with the others. Communication and understanding between each and every one for us is very crucial for the successful development of this website and also this project. This is something that we cannot learn from the textbook, we can only learn these soft skills through the process of collaborating with the others.That’s all for the execution phase of this project. I am very excited to see how people react ot our website but I am very sure that they will definitely be very amazed by us as I think we have done a really good job in developing this website. And as always, stay tuned for the next blog update!" }, { "title": "Wait, social what? - The Preparation", "url": "/posts/Social-Engagement-1/", "categories": "Social Engagement", "tags": "social-engagement", "date": "2022-04-06 21:19:21 +0800", "snippet": "The &amp;lt;meta content&amp;gt;To all my readers out there, don’t worry about me, I am all good, alright and still hang out with my friends during my free time. I am clarifying this as I am afraid that some of you might think that I am so disengaged from people’s relationships until I need to attend a course in university to regain my social life. 🌚As mentioned above, this course is named GIG1005 Social Engagement AKA Social Engagement. This course has only 1 main and compulsory task to the us, which is carry out an open public event which is impactful to the society. With that, the students are then able to engage with the society more in a meaningful and impactful(positively) way.Forming the crewWhat is the most crucial part of organizing an event? Forming the crew I would say. A great project always require the best crew.In our first lecture with our advisor which is Dr. Azah Anir Norman, we have selected the high committees for this event. I am so happy that I am able to get myself into the Department of Publicity as one the jobscope is to develop a website for this project. Furthermore, I am also collaborating with a lot of talented people which are happened to be part of the Publicity Dep too. I am looking forward to learn many things from them and I believe that joining this department will be one of the best decision I have ever made in my life.Behold! The brainstorm is hereAfter the first lecture, we have carried out a few discussions together with the memberts of Publicity Department to segregrate the jobs and also to discuss the design of the website. I am amazed by my classmates as their sense of art is totally in a different level. I will never be able to come up with such design by myself as the only thing I can draw very well is a Stickman.😥Part of Ching Yen’s WebsitePart of Wei Hong’s DesignPart of Janice &amp;amp; Jasmine’s DesignLanding Page of Shiao Yin &amp;amp; Wan Jun’s DesignWait, what is the name of the event? I am very proud to announce that the name of this event(or project) is called Digiteens: Unravelling the Bits🎉🎉🎉The reason behind is because of we are targeting the audience group between 12 years old to 23 years old and we are teaching them about digital awareness, unravelling them the facts about digitalisation and what benefits can we derive from this inevitable trend. I am very grateful as part of the name of this event is an idea of mine 😏.Last but not least, we also confirmed that we are going to use React as the main framework to be worked with as the nature of React is very suitable for this short development cycle. Plus, it is very easy to learn as long as you have a keyboard, a computer and a passion to learn new things.Photo of us discussing the requirement for the websiteSmall Wrap Up: PreparationAll in all, the preparation of our team is quite special as we are focusing on the website development more. This is because of the promotion work has to be on hold until the Multimedia team finish the production of the posters and promotional materials. Hence, I get to focus on discussing, gathering and merging the ideas from the development team and then unify them with the others in the same department into 1 perfect and complete idea. Through this, I get to know the thinking process of the others when they are designing the website and this is very meaningful to me as this experience can help me in improving my website designing skills. Furthermore, I appreciate that I am given this opportunity as now I know all of the people in this department better. Hooray!" } ]
