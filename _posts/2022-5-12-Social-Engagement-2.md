## Execution of the Project
Website development is fun but I think that normal people with 0 passion can do it. This is because the process of debugging and finetuning the website is very tedious and this requires a lot of patience to keep us from giving up. This is why I have mentioned a passion to learn new things is also one of the key criteria for this work. 

That's all for the preparation phase of this project. I am very excited to see how people react ot our website but I am very sure that they will definitely be very amazed by us as I think we have done a really good job in developing this website. The next blog will talk about the execution of our project. So stay tuned for that!
