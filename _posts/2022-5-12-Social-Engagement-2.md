## The *\<__meta content__\>*
From the last blog, we have done all the preparation for the works our department has to do. So now we will be make our planning comes true! As I am assigned (by  myself) to develop the website, this blog will only focus on my perspective and my feelings while developingthe webstie. Without any further ado, lets goooooooooooooooo!

## "Yeah I think I can handle the landing page"
For the non IT or webdev readers out there, you may be wondering what the heck is a landing page. Is it some sort of platform that allow something to land on? Well, yeah! A landing page is the first page user will see whent hey enter our website. So, the landing page has to be as attractive as possible. With only 10+ days of experience in learning React and 0 experience in developing a real, usable, built for an event website, I have picked up this important responsibility. I am feeling very excited but scared at the same time as I am scared that my work may not meet my teammates and my own expectations. But that is the story for later. 

## Developers heaven: Desktop view
Developing the desktop view of the website is easy as the canvas is big and we can basically do anything we want. As long as the outcome is the same as the design, it is an ok for sure. So, I tried to fancy up the view a little but by adding in some animations. I have added hover effects for each and every buttons, revealling animations for some components, scroll animations and side navigation bar animations to the landing page. Still, after the additions, the landing apge looks dull. It is not "wow" enough. She is lacking of some spice to make her looks hot. It was at this time, Kuck Swee Nien, part of the developer team had sent me a DM. It was Particle.js, a lightweight JavaScript library for creating particles. The library is then integrated into the landingpage of the website and voilaï¼Œ the desktop view for the landing page is done!!!! I am very satisfied with the result.

## Developers hell: Mobile view
Done developing the website for destop? Yes. Is the job done? No... It is time to deal with the responsiveness of the webstie.

What is website responsiveness? In non IT terms, it means how you make you website looks good even when the size of the viewport of users' device varies. Sounds easy right? No. A BIG NO in full caps. To achieve that, we have to set the breakpoints of the website with respect to its width and organize the layout of the website to fit the size of the viewport. As the designer does not include the design for the mobile view, I have to come up with my own design of the mobile look of the website base on the desktop version. As I have mentioned before, I am pathetic when it comes to the field of art. But hwoever this will not be the reason to stop me from advancing. In order to produce the mobile view of the website, I consulted Nah Wan Jun, part of the developer team and has experience in developing a responsive website. What I can say is I learn many things from her to make the website responsive. Now, we have both mobile and desktop view, I say thats the end of the development of landing page. Hoorayyyyy!!!!!!!

## Exposing it to the world
After the development, we merged each part of the website into one and done the user routing part. It is time for us to put this baby to the World Wide Web, where it will be accessible to anyone from anywhere. We have deployed it onto Netlify, a free website hosting service platform. We were so happy when we saw the deployment log said "Deployed successfully. The website is up and running.". We have put so much effort and time into this, it is time to let others acknowledge our work.  

The link for the website is [here](https://digiteens.netlify.app) . Feel free to visit it!!

## Small Wrap Up - Execution of the Project
Website development is fun but I think that normal people with 0 passion can do it. This is because the process of debugging and finetuning the website is very tedious and this requires a lot of patience to keep us from giving up. This is why I have mentioned a passion to learn new things is also one of the key criteria for this work.  

Besides, I also learned to express my ideas and cooperate with the others. Communication and understanding between each and every one for us is very crucial for the successful development of this website and also this project. This is something that we cannot learn from the textbook, we can only learn these soft skills through the process of collaborating with the others.

That's all for the execution phase of this project. I am very excited to see how people react ot our website but I am very sure that they will definitely be very amazed by us as I think we have done a really good job in developing this website. And as always, stay tuned for the next blog update!
