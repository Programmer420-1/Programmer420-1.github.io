## The *\<__meta content__\>*
By the time of writing, we are carring out our 3rd module which is ```Digital Security - Scams and Swindles 101```. Many things have happened so far and I can't wait to tell you all the stories. Let's get started!

## Not a good start, but we are gaining greatness
Despite all the preparation we have made, we still cannot prevent all of the unexepcted situations from happening. During the kick off event of our project, the representative of our main collaborator which is Meta was not able to join the Microsoft Team channel we have set up. At that time I was freaking out as I can't do anything about it to help getting the representative into our Microsoft Team channel. Luckily, the others reacted quickly and decided to use Google Meet for as an alternative channel to continue the event. Then everything went smoothly like a hot knife through the butter.  

To date, we have over 60 teenagers participated the last 2 modules and the head count is still increasing! This has to do with the effort of Publicity Department(which is us) and all of the committees in promoting, advertising and spreading the details of our project consistently in our main social media platforms which are Facebook and Instagram. Without eveyone's effort, our project will never stand a chance to attract so many participants and bring a lot of positive impact to the society by raising the awareness of digitalisation. I strongly believe that by the end of the project, we will have a total of 80 participants to join our project. 

## Regrets, Sadness and Sorrow
As I was involved in another event organized by Google, I was unable to attend the second module which is ```Digital Opportunity -  Dâ€™ALGORITHMER```, leaded by my friend Goh Qian Xuan. I didn't get to watch my friend giving lecture and most importantly I didn't get to listen to the content prepared by them. However, even though I was in another event, I still follow up with my teammates who were not involved in the Google event I was in at that time. Still, I feel sad as I was not able to attend the module.

## Lesson learnt
What have I learnt in this phase? Not much but fruitful I would say. After the Meta Representative Incident, I am aware that I have to improve my skill on handling unexpected situations. I should stay calm at time of crisis at all time in order to solve the problem more efficiently. I respect the other committees that solve this issue without getting panic. You guys really taught me a good lesson. Thanks!
