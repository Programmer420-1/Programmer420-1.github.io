## The *\<__meta content__\>*
To all my readers out there, don't worry about me, I am all good, alright and still hang out with my friends during my free time. I am clarifying this as I am afraid that some of you might think that I am so disengaged from people's relationships until I need to attend a course in university to regain my social life. üåö

As mentioned above, this course is named GIG1005 Social Engagement AKA *Social Engagement*. This course has only 1 main and compulsory task to the us, which is carry out an open public event which is impactful to the society. With that, the students are then able to engage with the society more in a meaningful and impactful(positively) way.


## Forming the crew
What is the most crucial part of organizing an event? Forming the crew I would say. 

> A great project always require the best crew.

In our first lecture with our advisor which is Dr. Azah Anir Norman, we have selected the high committees for this event. I am so happy that I am able to get myself into the Department of Publicity as one the jobscope is to develop a website for this project. Furthermore, I am also collaborating with a lot of talented people which are happened to be part of the Publicity Dep too. I am looking forward to learn many things from them and I believe that joining this department will be one of the best decision I have ever made in my life.  

## Behold! The brainstorm is here
After the first lecture, we have carried out a few discussions together with the memberts of Publicity Department to segregrate the jobs and also to discuss the design of the website. I am amazed by my classmates as their sense of art is totally in a different level. I will never be able to come up with such design by myself as the only thing I can draw very well is a Stickman.üò•

Wait, what is the name of the event? I am very proud to announce that the name of this event(or project) is called ***Digiteens: Unravelling the Bits***üéâüéâüéâ  

The reason behind is because of we are targeting the audience group between 12 years old to 23 years old and we are teaching them about digital awareness, **unravelling them the facts** about digitalisation and what benefits can we derive from this inevitable trend. I am very grateful as part of the name of this event is an idea of mine üòè.

Last but not least, we also confirmed that we are going to use React as the main framework to be worked with as the nature of React is very suitable for this short development cycle. Plus, it is very easy to learn as long as you have a keyboard, a computer and a passion to learn new things.

## Small Wrap Up: Preparation
All in all, the preparation of our team is quite special as we are focusing on the website development more. This is because of the promotion work has to be on hold until the Multimedia team finish the production of the posters and promotional materials. Hence, I get to focus on discussing, gathering and merging the ideas from the development team and then unify them with the others in the same department into 1 perfect and complete idea. Through this, I get to know the thinking process of the others when they are designing the website and this is very meaningful to me as this experience can help me in improving my website designing skills. Furthermore, I appreciate that I am given this opportunity as now I know all of the people in this department better. Hooray!
