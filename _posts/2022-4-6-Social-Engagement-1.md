## The *\<__meta content__\>*
To all my readers out there, don't worry about me, I am all good, alright and still hang out with my friends during my free time. I am clarifying this as I am afraid that some of you might think that I am so disengaged from people's relationships until I need to attend a course in university to regain my social life. üåö

As mentioned above, this course is named GIG1005 Social Engagement AKA *Social Engagement*. This course has only 1 main and compulsory task to the us, which is carry out an open public event which is impactful to the society. With that, the students are then able to engage with the society more in a meaningful and impactful(positively) way.


## Forming the crew
What is the most crucial part of organizing an event? Forming the crew I would say. 

> A great project always require the best crew.

In our first lecture with our advisor which is Dr. Azah Anir Norman, we have selected the high committees for this event. I am so happy that I am able to get myself into the Department of Publicity as one the jobscope is to develop a website for this project. Furthermore, I am also collaborating with a lot of talented people which are happened to be part of the Publicity Dep too. I am looking forward to learn many things from them and I believe that joining this department will be one of the best decision I have ever made in my life.  

## Behold! The brainstorm is here
After the first lecture, we have carried out a few discussions together with the memberts of Publicity Department to segregrate the jobs and also to discuss the design of the website. I am amazed by my classmates as their sense of art is totally in a different level. I will never be able to come up with such design by myself as the only thing I can draw very well is a Stickman.üò•

Wait, what is the name of the event? I am very proud to announce that the name of this event(or project) is called ***Digiteens: Unravelling the Bits***üéâüéâüéâ  

The reason behind is because of we are targeting the audience group between 12 years old to 23 years old and we are teaching them about digital awareness, **unravelling them the facts** about digitalisation and what benefits can we derive from this inevitable trend. I am very grateful as part of the name of this event is an idea of mine üòè.

Last but not least, we also confirmed that we are going to use React as the main framework to be worked with as the nature of React is very suitable for this short development cycle. Plus, it is very easy to learn as long as you have a keyboard, a computer and a passion to learn new things.

## Small Wrap Up: Preparation
Website development is fun but I think that normal people with 0 passion can do it. This is because the process of debugging and finetuning the website is very tedious and this requires a lot of patience to keep us from giving up. This is why I have mentioned a passion to learn new things is also one of the key criteria for this work.  

That's all for the preparation phase of this project. I am very excited to see how people react ot our website but I am very sure that they will definitely be very amazed by us as I think we have done a really good job in developing this website. The next blog will talk about the execution of our project. So stay tuned for that!
